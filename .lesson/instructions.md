### Recursion

#### Objective: To gain proficiency implementing recursive methods in java.


Write a *menu-driven* program that completes each task using only primitive data types.  Each task below must be a recursive method that solves the problem and meets the specifications, returning or printing as required. (The name of the method is in italics).  

 
1. *twos* takes a single positive integer as its argument and **returns** the number of factors of 2 in the number.  (Hint: odd numbers have no factors of 2, numbers that are twice an odd number have one, numbers that are four times an odd have two, and so on.) 

2. *powerOf3* takes a single positive integer argument and **returns** true iff the integer is a perfect power of 3 such as 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, â€¦, or false otherwise.
 
3. *reverse* takes a single positive integer argument and **displays** the result of reversing its digits.

4. *base5* takes a single positive integer argument and **displays** its base five equivalent.

5. *printWithCommas* takes a single positive integer argument and **displays** it with commas inserted properly.  **No use of String.**


#### Notes
* No class variables other than Scanner
* No arrays should be used.
* No Math methods allowed.
* No other classes or libraries are allowed.
* Your programs output should match the sample run.
* Reminder you may only use the knowledge of things we have discussed in class.
